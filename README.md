# 5LIU0_Project
In period B of the HBO-Top Embedded Systems pre-master on the TU Eindhoven, the 5LIU0 course was held.
As part of this course, a signals or control systems related project was to be done by the students.
I chose to write a program that:
1. Takes an input sinusoidal wave 
2. Calculates its DFT 
3. Feeds the result into a control system.

The included PDF details the design process.
The executable is called "gui.exe" and can be found under 5LIU0_Project/gui/application.windows64/
